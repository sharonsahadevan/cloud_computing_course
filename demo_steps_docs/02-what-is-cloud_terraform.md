# Introduction to terraform

The goal: show main terraform commands and how to use templates from this repository

1. How to run the commands

    The repository supports [VSCode remote containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). `/.devcontainer` directory contains a ready-to-go profile and dockerfile with required dependencies to run all the samples.

    You can run all the commands:

    - on your own environment, then you have to install all the used tools (terraform, az-cli, az-func, etc)
    - inside VSCode Remote Container, then you have to install docker and VSCode extantion [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
