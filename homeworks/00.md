# Homeworks

The course has four homeworks with main goal to build a summary project. Each task in the homework could be individual or team scoped - pay attention to comments!

To pass the course, you must:

1. Finish all mandatory tasks
2. Get at least 120 points out of 200 available

Each homework has a deadline date. Finishing homeworks after deadline date is allowed, but final score will be reduced by 1 point for each overdue day (not more than -20 for a single homework-day)

## Homework requirements

- Each student maintains a git repository with completed tasks (code, docs, images)
- In case of group tasks, only one copy is sufficient. For example, one student repository has the group results, the rest of teammates reference this repo
- You can pick any cloud platform of your choice

## Capstone project

- Capstone project should include 5+ cloud services.
- You can peak any project you worked on in previous courses (event-streaming, distributed systems, system architecture, etc) and reimplement it in a cloud of your choice.
- Or you can implement your own idea ;)

### Project ideas

- Fridges emit telemetry: target and current temperature, door is opened or closed. Cloud saves the data; allows temperature trends queries; alerts if door is opened more than 30 seconds or if target temperature is not equal to target.
- Social media data ingestion. Enrich data with sentiment; calculate trends: most used words every hour/day; most popular sentiment by time of the day.
- Play with stackoverflow [public data dump](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/download-the-current-stack-overflow-database-for-free-2021-02/): stream messages, store  a subset of data and analyse it: most used or most voted tools/languages/frameworks per day/month, most commented posts
- Analyze you spotify listening habits: listening time per month, analyze [tracks features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-several-audio-features), stream new tracks
