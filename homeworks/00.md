# Homeworks

The course has four homeworks with main goal to build a summary project. Each task in the homework could be individual or team scoped - pay attention to comments!

To pass the course, you must:

1. Finish all mandatory tasks
2. Get at least 120 points out of 200 available

Each homework has a deadline date. Finishing homeworks after deadline date is allowed, but final score will be reduced by 1 point for each overdue day (not more than -20 for a single homework-day)
