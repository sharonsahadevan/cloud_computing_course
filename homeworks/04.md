# Day 4

## 1. (mandatory, 20 pt) Pricing calculator

**The goal**: You should know how much does your project cost now, with 10x, 100x load.

As a side effect, during pricing estimation you often can better understand the implications and limitations of choosen cloud components.

### Deliveries

Document in project git-repository with

- estimated target price
- expected price if amount of users/data increases 10x/100x times
- conclusion:
    - what is the most expensive part of the project,
    - if there is a way to reduce the bill,
    - if the price changes linearly/logarithmically/exponentially and what causes this change.

## 2. (optional, 15 pt) Logs, metrics, alerts

**The goal**: make your project _observable_.

Used cloud components emits application and audit logs, diagnostics data, metrics. You should be able to:

- perform a historical analysis of this data
- slice and dice the observations
- understand what happened at time X
- how system behavior changed between point Y and Z

### Deliveries

- documents and screenshots how and where to find the data
- automated (or documented) observability configuration

## 3. (optional, 10 pt) Autoscaling

**The goal**: Your project should be able to scale within expected scale range without baby-sitting it.

### Deliveries

- include into project README expected scale ranges and ways to achieve it
- automated (or documented) autoscaling configuration
