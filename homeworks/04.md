- conclusion:
    - what is the most expensive part of the project,
    - if there is a way to reduce the bill,
    - if the price changes linearly/logarithmically/exponentially and what causes this change.

- do a historical analysis of this data
- slice and dice the observations

### Deliveries

- documents and screenshots how and where to find the data
- automated observability configuration

## 3. (team, optional, 10 pt) Autoscaling

Your project should be able to scale within expected scale range without baby-sitting it

### Deliveries

- include into design-doc or project description expected scale ranges and ways to achieve it
- automated autoscaling configuration
