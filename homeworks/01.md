# Day 1

## 1. (team) Organize into teams

The main project and some homeworks should be completed in teams. The team size could be from 1 (one) to 4 (four) persons. While forming the team consider:

- desired cloud. Multi-cloud is possible, but, likely, will be harder to implement.
- skillset and points of interest. For example if teammates are interested in different parts of cloud, your project might cover more aspects in depth and you can share your knowledge and findings.

### Deliveries

- list of team members
- desired cloud(s)
- [optional] team name

## 2. (individual) Create cloud accounts

Create you own **personal** account in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

### Deliveries

- screenshot of cloud web-interface with your account name on it
- cost alert

## 3. (individual) Terraform introduction

Individually complete one of [AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started), [Azure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/azure-get-started) or [GCP](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/gcp-get-started) terraform tutorials.

### Deliveries

- Reference to git repositories with created Terraform configuration
- Cloud web-interface screenshots with created resources
