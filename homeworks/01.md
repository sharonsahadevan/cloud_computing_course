# Day 1

## 1. (mandatory, 20 pt) Terraform introduction

**The goal**: try terraform in action.

Individually complete one of [AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started), [Azure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/azure-get-started) or [GCP](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/gcp-get-started) terraform tutorials.

### Deliveries

NOTE: Terraform state could contain [sensitive data](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html). It's better not to commit it to git repository to avoid accidental secrets leak. Consider adding it to [.gitignore](../.gitignore) file.

- Reference to git repositories with created Terraform configuration
- Cloud web-interface screenshots with created resources
