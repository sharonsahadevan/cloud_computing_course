# Day 2

## 1. (team) Choose a project

The goal: write down a high-level description of capstone project

You have to describe your project in few paragraphs: idea and high-level design

Consider using **simplified** design-doc templates for this task. You can define skeleton doc now and add more details during the following homeworks later.

The articles describe full-blown design-docs:

- [design doc by Google engineer](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/)
- [design doc by AWS engineer](https://medium.com/machine-words/writing-technical-design-docs-revisited-850d36570ec)
- [How to write a good software design doc](https://link.medium.com/AjcWfsa0r7) by Angela Zhang

### Deliveries

Reference to git repository with:

- Project README file
- system design diagram(s)
- [optional] (data-)flow diagrams

## 2. (individual) Function as a Service sample

The goal: to try in the wild real FaaS offering.

We expect you to implement HTTP-triggered Function, which stores incoming HTTP request content in a cloud Object storage as json file.

### Requirements

- Function could be triggered via HTTP request
- Function does not allow anonymous access
- Content of a request is stored as json file in Object Store
- New requests does not override any file in Object Store

### Deliveries

- Reference to git repository with FaaS sources
- Cloud web-interface screenshots to prove function successful invocation
