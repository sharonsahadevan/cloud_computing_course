# Homeworks

The course has four homeworks with main goal to build a summary project. To pass the course, you must get at least 120 points out from 200 possible.

## Homework requirements

- Each student maintains a git repository with completed tasks (code, docs, images)
- You can pick any cloud platform of your choice

## Capstone project

- Capstone project should include 5+ cloud services.
- You can peak any project you worked on in other courses and reimplement it in a cloud of your choice.
- Or you can implement your own idea ;)

### Project ideas

- Fridges emit telemetry: target and current temperature, door is opened or closed. Cloud saves the data; allows temperature trends queries; alerts if door is opened more than 30 seconds or if target temperature is not equal to target.
- Social media data ingestion. Enrich data with sentiment; calculate trends: most used words every hour/day; most popular sentiment by time of the day.
- Play with stackoverflow [public data dump](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/download-the-current-stack-overflow-database-for-free-2021-02/). for example, stream messages, store  a subset of data, and analyse it: most used or most voted tools/languages/frameworks per day/month, most commented posts
- Analyze your spotify listening habits: listening time per month, analyze [tracks features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features), stream new tracks
- ...


## List of tasks

The course has mandatory and optional tasks:

- Mandatory: focus on the most important aspects of developing your project within a cloud environment.
- Optional: cover topics that are less visible at first, but important for project to succeed in a long run.

To complete the course, at least 120 points are required.
